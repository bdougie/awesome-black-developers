At the moment I am using an action to print the markdown for developers into the logs and copy and pasting that into markdown.:
- "## Make it better"
- "- [x] Move the array of developers out of [update-photos.rb](https://github.com/bdougie/awesome-black-developers/blob/303765cb04aab1cdac58d9951a6ef97b08ee3b2b/action/update-photos.rb#L6-L14)
  and into its own file"
- "- [x] Have the action print the new photos to a file or directly in the readme
  through automation."
- "- [x] Update the CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect the above changes."
