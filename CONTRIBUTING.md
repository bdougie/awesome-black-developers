# Contributing

Additional suggestions are welcomed! Please [open a PR](https://github.com/bdougie/awesome-black-developers/pulls).

Criteria:
* Content is about the experience of being the developer.
* The author of the content is describing their own experience.

This list is sorted alphabetically by GitHub username. Sub-bullets are also sorted alphabetically by title. The format is as follows:

```
[@USERNAME](https://github.com/USERNAME),
  * "TITLE" ([video/slides/post/interview/project/community](URL))
```

Maximum 5 links per developer are permitted. If a developer already has the maximum number of links listed, your pull request should remove an existing link in order to make room for your contribution, with an explanation as to why you think it adds more value.

*Photo table of the developers should not be updated directly and instead handled through automation.*
