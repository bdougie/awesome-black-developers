# Contributing

Additional suggestions are welcomed! Please [open a PR](https://github.com/bdougie/awesome-black-developers/pulls).

Criteria to add a developer:
* Content is about the experience of being the developer.
* The author of the content is describing their own experience.
* Projects linked must be open sourced and/or non-profit.

## Adding to the README.md
This list is sorted alphabetically by GitHub username. Sub-bullets are also sorted alphabetically by title. The format is as follows:

```
[@USERNAME](https://github.com/USERNAME),
  * "TITLE" ([video/slides/post/interview/project/community](URL))
```

Maximum 5 links per developer are permitted. If a developer already has the maximum number of links listed, your pull request should remove an existing link to make room for your contribution, with an explanation as to why you think it adds more value.

## Adding to the photos
The photo wall of the developers should not be updated directly and instead handled through automation.

Please add the developer login to this [action/update-photos.rb](https://github.com/bdougie/awesome-black-developers/blob/main/action/update-photos.rb#L6-L7) file for the photo wall update.
