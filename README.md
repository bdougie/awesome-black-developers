 * ## Make it better
 * - [x] Move the array of developers out of [update-photos.rb](https://github.com/bdougie/awesome-black-developers/blob/303765cb04aab1cdac58d9951a6ef97b08ee3b2b/action/update-photos.rb#L6-L14) and into its own file
 * - [x] Have the action print the new photos to a file or directly in the readme through automation.
 * - [ ] Update the CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect the above changes.
